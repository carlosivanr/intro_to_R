## Pre-workshop instructions
Since we will be covering X, Y, and Z in R. First we will need to have a working setup of R and RStudio on your computer.

Install Software
- [Install R](http://cran.wustl.edu/)
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Install Packages
One of the cool things about R is that you can modify its functionality to streamline some of the tasks that can be tedious or to gain functionality. This is accomplished by installing packages. An R package is somewhat analogous to a plug-in for your browser, it can change how the original software works.

- Open RStudio
- Click on the "Console" tab in the left hand pane of RStudio
- To install packages type:
 ```{r}
 install.packages("name of package)
 ```
